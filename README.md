# local-prune
## About
This is a script created to prune any local branches which are tracking deleted remote branches. It annoyed me that I had to do this manually, so I made this.
## Installation
I will add this later
## Usage
Go into your local repo, and type `prune-local`. It is important that you are in your repo when you do this, as the script references `$PWD`.
